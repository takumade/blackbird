# Crow - Unofficial Twitter Client
## Whats Crow

![Crow](./images/usecase.jpg)

Is an unofficial Twitter client written in selenium and node js. Keep in mind that everything is not done for you. ðŸ˜„ So you to join the parts/blocks of code to achieve whatever outcome you want. 

Its more like a library where you are given classes(the blocks) and you have to join them in a certain way or configuration inorder to achieve your goal(a giant toy or robot or whatever) 

With that said i am not reponsible if you get suspended from twitter. Be a good netizen and follow the rules. Noobs! be careful

## How to Install
1. Clone the project

        git clone https://github.com/takumade/crow.git

2. Install node modules

        cd crow && npm install

## Important

Before you can you can do anything you need to first get a twitter client. A twitter client is a logged in user

1. Add your creds in `constants.ts`
```js
export const username = "username"
export const password = "password"
```

**The constants file contains many options that you may want to play with**

2. Now obtain a client and .....play

```js
import { TwitterClient } from "./classes/crow/twitter_client"

const getTweets = async () =>  {
   try{

        let client = new TwitterClient()
        let result = await client.getClient()
        
        if(result){
           // Do your stuff here
           
        }

    }catch(e){
        console.log(e)
    }
}
```

```js
// Get Twitter client first
let trends = await client.getTrends()        
```

**2. Tweet something**
```js
// Get Twitter client first
await client.tweet("Hello World! how are you");
```

**3. Like, Retweet and Reply a tweet**

...
// get client first 
let tweet = new Tweet(client.driver, <tweetUrl>)
await tweet.like()
await tweet.retweet()
await tweet.reply("Sounds Awesome!")
```

**4. Get user info**

```js
import User from "./classes/crow/user"
...
//get client first
let user = new User(client.driver, <username>)
let info = await user.getUserInfo()
```

**5. Follow user**
